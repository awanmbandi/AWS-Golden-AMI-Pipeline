##Update
On 12/1/2019, AWS released EC2 Image Builder, which simplifies the creation, maintenance, validation, sharing, and deployment of Linux or Windows Server images. We now recommend AWS customers use EC2 Image Builder to manage your golden images. Find out more about [EC2 Image Builder here](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder), and read this blog post [Automate OS image build pipelines with EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/automate-os-image-build-pipelines-with-ec2-image-builder).
